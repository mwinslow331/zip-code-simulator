This is an application created in React designed to automatically calculate
the distance between two zip codes in miles once a user enters two zip codes
in their respective fields.

While there are APIs available to calculate this I will be writing the algorithm
that does the calculations using a database from
http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/.
